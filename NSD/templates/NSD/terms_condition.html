            <h3>NEVADA SWIM HUB - SWIMMING RULES</h3>
            <p>Welcome to <strong>Nevada Swim HUB</strong>! We're excited to have you here. To keep everyone safe and make sure you have the best time possible, here are a few important things to keep in mind when you’re in or around the pool.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Be Cool, Be Kind</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Listen to your instructors and lifeguards — they're here to help you stay safe and have fun.</li>
                        <li>Be respectful to others in the pool. No pushing, splashing, or rough play.</li>
                        <li>Stay where you're supposed to be — no sneaking into off-limits areas.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Stay Clean and Ready</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Take a quick shower before jumping in — it helps keep the water clean for everyone.</li>
                        <li>Wear proper swimwear. No jeans, T-shirts, or regular clothes in the pool.</li>
                        <li>If you’re sick or have open wounds, please wait until you’re healthy again.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Safety First, Always</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Never swim alone. Make sure there’s an instructor or lifeguard around.</li>
                        <li>No running on the pool deck — it's slippery.</li>
                        <li>Diving? Only in deep water and only if your instructor says it's okay.</li>
                        <li>Know the signals. One whistle = stop and look. Multiple = clear the pool.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Bring the Right Stuff</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Water bottles are great — stay hydrated! But no food, drinks, or gum in the pool area.</li>
                        <li>Only use gear approved by your coach or instructor.</li>
                        <li>Lock your belongings — we’re not responsible for lost items.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Be on Time, Join the Fun</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Arrive early so you’re ready when class starts.</li>
                        <li>Let us know if you’re going to miss class. We understand!</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>For Our Amazing Parents</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Watch from the viewing area — it helps the kids focus.</li>
                        <li>Keep an eye on children not in class.</li>
                        <li>If you have questions, ask at the front desk or message us.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Let’s Keep It Positive</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We want everyone to feel safe, encouraged, and supported.</li>
                        <li>If there's ever a problem, talk to us — we’re here to help.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>We wish you a happy swimming experience! Thanks for being part of the Nevada Swim Hub family. Let’s dive in and make a splash — safely, confidently, and with a smile!</p>
